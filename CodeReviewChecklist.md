# Code Review Checklist

## Phase 1: Input Security Implementation ✅

### Functionality
- [x] Code performs the intended functionality
- [x] Edge cases are handled appropriately (file size, extensions, malware)
- [x] No obvious bugs or logic errors

### Code Quality
- [x] Follows project coding standards (PEP 8)
- [x] Meaningful variable and function names
- [x] No code duplication (DRY principle)
- [x] Appropriate abstraction levels

### Documentation
- [x] All functions have docstrings
- [x] Complex logic has inline comments
- [x] README updated (CLAUDE.md created)
- [x] API documentation structure planned

### Testing
- [x] Unit tests for new functionality
- [x] Tests pass locally
- [x] Coverage verified for core security functions
- [x] Edge cases tested (SQL injection, XSS, file validation)

### Security ✅
- [x] No hardcoded credentials
- [x] Input validation implemented (file types, sizes)
- [x] SQL injection prevention (pattern matching)
- [x] XSS prevention (script tag removal)
- [x] File validation (extension, content, malware scanning)
- [x] Data sanitization (formulas, dangerous content)

### Performance
- [x] No obvious performance issues
- [x] Efficient algorithms used (regex patterns)
- [ ] Database queries optimized (not applicable yet)
- [ ] Caching implemented where appropriate (planned for Phase 2)

### Error Handling
- [x] Appropriate exception handling (custom security exceptions)
- [x] Meaningful error messages
- [ ] Logging implemented (basic structure, to be enhanced)
- [x] Graceful degradation
