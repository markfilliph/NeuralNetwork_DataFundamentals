## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL MISSING COMPONENTS

### **Data Encryption Service** (From Original Plan Week 3)
- [ ] File encryption/decryption with Fernet 
- [ ] Secure key management and rotation
- [ ] Encryption at rest implementation
- [ ] **STATUS: COMPLETELY MISSING - High Priority**

### **Database & Persistence Layer**
- [ ] Database connection and models
- [ ] Data persistence (all data currently in-memory)
- [ ] User storage and session persistence
- [ ] Audit log persistence to database
- [ ] **STATUS: COMPLETELY MISSING - High Priority**

### **API Endpoints & HTTP Layer**
- [ ] FastAPI route implementation
- [ ] HTTP request/response handling
- [ ] Authentication endpoints (/login, /logout, /register)
- [ ] Protected data endpoints
- [ ] **STATUS: COMPLETELY MISSING - High Priority**

### **Dependency Alignment Issues**
- [ ] Replace custom JWT with `jose` library (as per original plan)
- [ ] Replace PBKDF2 with `passlib`+bcrypt (as per original plan)
- [ ] Add missing external dependencies
- [ ] **STATUS: Implementation differs from plan**

### **Caching Layer**
- [ ] Redis integration
- [ ] Multi-level caching strategy
- [ ] Session caching
- [ ] **STATUS: PLANNED BUT NOT IMPLEMENTED**

## Future Phases

### Phase 3: Missing Core Components (URGENT)
- [ ] Data encryption service implementation
- [ ] Database integration and persistence
- [ ] FastAPI endpoints and HTTP layer
- [ ] Dependency alignment with original plan

### Phase 4: Scalability Enhancement
- [ ] Horizontal scaling architecture
