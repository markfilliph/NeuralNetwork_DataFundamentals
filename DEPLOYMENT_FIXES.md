# Deployment Issues and Fixes

## Current Status: ❌ Dataset Upload Not Working

### Issues Identified:

1. **Missing Dependencies** ✅ FIXED
   - FastAPI, uvicorn, pydantic ✅
   - python-multipart ✅
   - redis ✅
   - openpyxl, xlrd ✅
   - email-validator (simplified) ✅

2. **Configuration Issues** 🔧 NEEDS FIXING
   - Redis connection not configured properly
   - Cache service failing without Redis server
   - File paths not properly configured

3. **Database Issues** 🔧 NEEDS FIXING
   - SQLite database exists but tables may not be initialized
   - Database schema not properly set up

4. **Service Dependencies** 🔧 NEEDS FIXING
   - Cache service depends on Redis server (not running)
   - Encryption service needs proper key management
   - File handlers need proper directory structure

## Immediate Fixes Needed:

### 1. Fix Cache Service (Redis Dependency)
The cache service is trying to connect to Redis but no Redis server is running.

### 2. Fix Database Initialization
The database tables need to be properly initialized.

### 3. Fix File Upload Pipeline
The file upload process has several dependency issues.

### 4. Fix Configuration Management
Environment variables and paths need proper setup.

## Quick Fix Strategy:

1. **Disable Redis temporarily** - Use in-memory cache
2. **Initialize database properly** - Create tables if missing
3. **Fix file upload dependencies** - Ensure all file handlers work
4. **Test upload workflow** - End-to-end testing

## Deployment Checklist:

- [ ] All Python dependencies installed
- [ ] Database tables initialized
- [ ] File directories created
- [ ] Cache service working (in-memory fallback)
- [ ] File upload endpoint working
- [ ] Authentication working
- [ ] Dataset analysis working
- [ ] Model training working (optional)

## Next Steps:

1. Create simplified cache service without Redis
2. Initialize database tables
3. Test file upload workflow
4. Deploy and test complete system
